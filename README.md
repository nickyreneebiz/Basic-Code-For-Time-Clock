# Basic-Code-For-Time-Clock
Title says it all; simple yet trackable
In case you can't tell I have absolutely no clue how github works, I just like to try new code.
I got tired of my work's time punch system being unreliable and having no way to double check what I had logged.
So this is my backup. Feel free to adapt the code how you like. TYSM
